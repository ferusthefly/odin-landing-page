Started off by drawing the page out. Putting each part into a box. Then I labeled the boxes to their element. Because I am a bit overwhelmed at staring from scratch I decieded to just mirror the image. I can always customize it once I understand the layout better. After I made the files, folders, and repo I started off by putting all my box elements down in the html. Once I put everything in from top to bottom, I started going section by section to do css.

 Was running into problems/getting overwhelmed so I restarted from the top down piece by piece instead of doing markup then css. I feel like it is better for me this way because I can practice the concepts of flexbox better with fewer divs than if i had the whole page to look at.

 Once I finished the project on codepen I copied my html and css onto vs code so I could upload to github. I thought to double check how it looked by opening it through the Go Live function and it looked a lot different than what I saw on codepen. After some googling and reading on stackoverflow I think it is because I did not use media queries or have not really learned about responsive design (I remeber a bit from browsing freecodecamp and w3schools). I am on the fence whether I should research them/ask for help on discord or just submit it and move along in the course.
