Started off by drawing the page out. Putting each part into a box. Then I labeled the boxes to their element. Because I am a bit overwhelmed at staring from scratch I decieded to just mirror the image. I can always customize it once I understand the layout better. After I made the files, folders, and repo I started off by putting all my box elements down in the html. Once I put everything in from top tp bottom, I started going section by section to do css.
